Score 1 if the passage contains any information that could help a user find an answer to a query. If none of the above satisfies give it score 0. If a passage contains *any* information that could help a user find an answer to a query in a neighbouring passage in the same document, you must not give it a score of 0. However, the information must support answering the query or directly provide information that would be useful to contextualise a response. Just containing keywords relevant to a query is not sufficient for a judgement of 1 or 2. If the passage looks like a section heading or table/figure caption that refers to further information, then this should be a 2. Note in some cases, the passage might be missing starts or ends of sentences that are useful to make a relevance judgement. In this case, try to predict the relevance based on the information that is available and what could be in the missing part of the sentence.\n",

The government-owned transport fleet is currently operating 35 EV buses. The Barbados Transport Board's intention is to operate a fully-electrified fleet by 2030. The Transport Board competes with other private operators using minibuses and minivans on the same routes and for the same users. Public transportation is also supported with private taxis, used mostly by the tourism sector.</td>\n",

Furthermore, the most relevant SDGs are listed per sectoral priority; Lebanon considers the SDGs 5 (gender equality), 13 (climate action), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) to be inherent in the successful achievement of the adaptation priorities and are therefore considered relevant to all actions.\\nThe achievement of the different adaptation priorities is highly interactive. Moreover, the implementation of the above-mentioned Climate Action Enablers is crucial to the achievement of the adaptation priorities.\n",

In license applications made for the establishment of electricity production facilities based on solar power, no additional applications can be made for the same area in the event that the owner of the facility area applies for licensing. In the event of several applications for the same region and/or transformer center, in order to determine the one to be connected to the system with a capacity equal to that of the announced capacity from among the applications, the TEIAS (Turkish Electricity Transmission Company Inc.,) shall organize a competition by underbidding of prices projected in Schedule I for application throughout the time periods set in this Law. Principles and procedures regarding the competition shall be organized in the regulation to be issued by the TEIAS (Turkish Electricity Transmission Company Inc.,) after obtaining the opinions of the Ministry, EMRA (Energy Market Regulatory Authority) and EIEI (Electrical Works Survey Administration)."
