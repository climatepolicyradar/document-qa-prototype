    "- this uptick is accepted in return for the lynx reasoning and remaining on the safe side for response evaluation\n",
    "- we currently have a no-response machine: more than 70% of all responses (after filtering CoT) are no-response cases. We can observer a large variance though in which models tend not to respond\n",

This suggests that the policy does consider the potential impact of tariff increases on marginalized communities with limited economic resources.   \n",

       "125  - The Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) includes measures to support the integration of digital technologies in the primary and secondary education system. [2]\\n- The RRP also includes measures to integrate digital technologies in the primary and secondary education system, including the use of digital resources in classrooms, the digitalisation of educational contents, and the creation of laboratories with educational technologies like programmable robots.
