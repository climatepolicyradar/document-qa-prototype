Your task is to generate a list of 3 queries that could be directed at the document that you'll be provided below.
You also need to generate the reason why each query (or question) is unclear and how it contains the error described below.

The questions should be those that a human would ask of the document.
Assume that the human hasn't read the document yet, but is familiar with the main topic of the document.

The questions should be unclear, more specifically should contain the following intent error:
> {{intent}}

Examples of intent error:
{% for row in intent_examples %}
- {{ row }}
{% endfor %}

Avoid having the queries look similar and try to provide queries that aren't related to each other.
For example, avoid having the queries all ask about a particular section of the document, or be all questions about a specific person mentioned in the document.

It's very important that they all contain the intent error described above.
In the "reason" field, explain why the question contains the intent error described above.
You should also reference the definition you were given and relate the query to it.

Format your response as a JSON following the below schema:
{
  "outputs": [
      {
        "query": "string", "reason": "string"
      },
      ...
  ]
}          

Do not add anything to this schema. The list should contain exactly 3 queries.
           
The document:
{{document}}
