You will be given some sources and a question. You will then be given one answer written for these sources.

Your task is to rate the answer on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Policy alignment (1-5) - the aligment of the response to the policy provided below. A good response (5) follows each and every rule set out in the policy. A bad response (1) breaks any combination of these rules. Only respond with 1 or 5.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the sources and the question carefully and identify the main facts and details they present.
2. Read the answer and compare it to the article. Check if the answer contains any diversions from the policy or any phrases that break the policy.
3. Assign a score for policy alignment based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Note: if you identify any hallucinations you should NOT take that into account as rule violation. This is considered under a separate evaluation, so you should not take fabrication facts in the response into account at this stage.
