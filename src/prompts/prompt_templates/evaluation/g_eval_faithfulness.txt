You will be given some sources and a question. You will then be given one answer written for these sources.

Your task is to rate the answer on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the answer and the sources. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize answers that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the sources and the question carefully and identify the main facts and details they present.
2. Read the answer and compare it to the article. Check if the answer contains any factual errors that are not supported by the article.
3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.


- Output ONLY the score, no other text.
- Output ONLY the score as a number. 
- The output should pass an is_digit() check.
