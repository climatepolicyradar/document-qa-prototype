# Task
Generate a list of 5 search term queries that could be asked by a human of the document that is provided below.
Assume that the human hasn't read the document yet, but is familiar with the main topic of the document.

- Generate search keywords only, not questions
- Don't use too many words
- Generate search keywords that are relevant to the document and that a human might use to search for information in the document
- Avoid generating similar queries
- Generate queries that aren't related to each other.

For example, avoid having the queries all ask about a particular section of the document, or be all questions about a specific person mentioned in the document.

Format your response as a JSON following the below schema:
{"queries": list[str]}

Do not add anything to this schema. The list should contain exactly 5 queries. The queries should be very different from each other.

The document:
{{document}}
