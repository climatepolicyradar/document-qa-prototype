# Task
Generate a list of 5 queries that could be asked by a human of the document that is provided below. The queries should require summarisation of lengthy sections of the document to answer. 

Assume that the human hasn't read the document yet, but is familiar with the main topic of the document.

# Examples
You are provided some examples of real queries below. The generated queries should be similar to these.

The example queries are not examples for this specific task, but are examples of real queries that we've seen in practice. You should generate queries that are similar but MAKE SURE THEY MATCH THE TASK GIVEN ABOVE. 

Examples of real queries:
{% for row in seed_queries %}
- {{ row.text }}
{% endfor %}

# Rules and instructions
- Generate queries that require summarisation of lengthy sections of the document to answer.
- Avoid generating similar queries
- Generate queries that aren't related to each other.

For example, avoid having the queries all ask about a particular section of the document, or be all questions about a specific person mentioned in the document.

Some of the above queries are keywords. Aim to generate similar or exactly the same keywords as in the list, if relevant for the document.

Format your response as a JSON following the below schema:
{"queries": list[str]}

Do not add anything to this schema. The list should contain exactly 5 queries. The queries should be very different from each other.

The document:
{{document}}
