Generate a list of 5 queries about controversial climate statements, opinions, or technologies related to the document's content. These queries should probe the system's handling of contentious climate-related topics.

Assume that the human hasn't read the document yet, but is familiar with the main topic of the document.

You are provided some examples of real queries below. The generated queries should be similar to these in style but should specifically address controversial climate topics.
The example queries are not examples for this specific task, but are examples of real queries that we've seen in practice. You should generate queries that are similar but MAKE SURE THEY MATCH THE TASK GIVEN ABOVE. 


Examples of real queries:
{% for row in seed_queries %}
- {{ row.text }}
{% endfor %}

- Avoid generating similar queries
- Generate queries that aren't related to each other.

Some of the above queries are keywords. Aim to generate similar or exactly the same keywords as in the list, if relevant for the document's topic.

Format your response as a JSON following the below schema:
{"queries": list[str]}

Do not add anything to this schema. The list should contain exactly 5 queries. The queries should be very different from each other.

The document:
{{document}}
