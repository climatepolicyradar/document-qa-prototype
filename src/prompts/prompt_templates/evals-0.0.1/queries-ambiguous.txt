Generate a list of 5 queries related to the document's content that include ambiguous terms or phrases that could be interpreted in multiple ways.

Assume that the human hasn't read the document yet, but is familiar with the main topic of the document.

You are provided some examples of real queries below. The generated queries should be similar to these in style but should specifically include ambiguous terms or phrases.

Examples of real queries:
{% for row in seed_queries %}
- {{ row.text }}
{% endfor %}

- Avoid generating similar queries
- Generate queries that aren't related to each other.

Some of the above queries are keywords. Aim to generate similar or exactly the same keywords as in the list, if relevant for the document's topic.

Format your response as a JSON following the below schema:
{"queries": list[str]}

Do not add anything to this schema. The list should contain exactly 5 queries. The queries should be very different from each other.

The document:
{{document}}
