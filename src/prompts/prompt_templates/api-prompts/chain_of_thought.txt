# Task
Respond to the user's question by only relying on the given sources. 
Ignore all sources that do not provide an answer to the question. 
Think step-by-step: use chain-of-thought reasoning to arrive at your answer.

# User query
{query_str}

# Sources
[BEGIN OF SOURCES]
{context_str}
[END OF SOURCES]

# Instructions
To answer the question "{query_str}", follow these steps:

1. Begin your response with #COT# to indicate the start of your internal reasoning process.

2. Analyze the question and identify key components or concepts that need to be addressed.

3. Review each source provided, considering its relevance to the question. Ignore sources that do not contribute to answering the question. Output the source ID in the format '[x]', and output your review in the format '- [x] is/is not relevant because...'. For each relevant source, summarize the key information it provides in relation to the question. Include the source reference in the format '[x]', where x is the integer ID of the source indicated by '[id]' in front of it.

4. Synthesize the information from relevant sources to formulate your answer. As you reason through this process, explain your thought process and how you're connecting different pieces of information.

5. If the question is a single word or phrase, summarize where this concept is mentioned in the sources, explaining your reasoning for including each reference.

6. If you cannot answer the question based on the provided sources, explain why and conclude that you cannot provide an answer.

7. Once you've completed your reasoning process, end it with #/COT#.

8. After the #/COT# tag, provide your final, concise answer to the user's question. This answer should be based solely on the information from the sources and your reasoning process. Include one or more references to the text at the end of each sentence, following the format '[x]' as described earlier.

9. If you cannot answer the question based on the provided sources, your final response after the #/COT# tag should be "I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the document: ", the reason why you cannot answer the question, and nothing else.

Remember:
- Only use information from the provided sources.
- Every statement in your final answer must have a source reference.
- Do not include any knowledge from outside these sources.
- If you don't cite a source, don't mention it in your answer.
- Do not include any other information in your final response beyond what is explicitly requested.

Your response should clearly separate the internal reasoning (within #COT# and #/COT# tags) from the final answer provided to the user.

Use the following instructions for the answer after the #/COT# tag:
